# OWID Cloud Data Platform (Azure)

An end-to-end data engineering project that demonstrates ingestion, transformation, and analytics-ready data modeling using **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** and **Python**.  
The project implements a full **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** with production-style design choices such as snapshot-based ingestion, data quality enforcement, surrogate keys, star-schema modeling, and Gold-layer aggregations.

This project is intentionally designed to prioritize **correctness, reproducibility, and analytics value** over unnecessary tooling.

The platform follows a layered lakehouse-style architecture:

- **Bronze Layer**  
  Raw OWID CO₂ data ingested directly from the web and stored unchanged using snapshot-based partitioning to guarantee lineage and reproducibility.

- **Silver Layer**  
  Cleaned and standardized data with enforced schemas, data quality checks, and conversion to Parquet for efficient analytics.

- **Gold Layer**  
  Analytics-ready datasets modeled using dimensional design principles, including fact tables, dimension tables, and precomputed aggregations optimized for BI consumption.

All data is stored on **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** with hierarchical namespace enabled, and **Parquet** is used as the columnar storage format.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Azure Blob Storage / Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2  
- Pandas  
- PyArrow (Parquet)  
- Requests  
- Git & GitHub  

---

## 📊 Data Source

**Our World in Data (OWID) – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset**

- Public and non-copyrighted  
- Widely used in research, sustainability reporting, and policy analysis  
- Suitable for reproducible data engineering workflows  

---

## 🥉 Bronze Layer

The Bronze layer ingests raw data from the OWID public source without modification.  
Data is stored using **snapshot-based partitioning** (`snapshot_date=YYYY-MM-DD`) to ensure deterministic re-runs, historical traceability, and safe backfills. No transformations or assumptions are applied at this stage.

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer

The Silver layer applies data cleaning and standardization, including:

- Column name normalization (snake_case)
- Data type enforcement
- Removal of invalid or incomplete records
- Fail-fast data quality checks (null validation, year range validation)
- Conversion from CSV to Parquet for columnar storage efficiency

Snapshot handling is parameterized to guarantee consistency between upstream and downstream layers.

---

## 🥇 Gold Layer

The Gold layer exposes analytics-ready datasets following **dimensional modeling best practices**.  
A **star schema** is implemented using surrogate keys to optimize joins and decouple analytics from changing business identifiers.

Gold datasets include:

- **Dimension tables**
  - `dim_country`

- **Fact tables**
  - `fact_emissions` (country × year × emissions metrics)

- **Aggregation tables**
  - Global emissions by year  
  - Top emitting countries per year  
  - CO₂ emissions per capita  

These tables are designed to be consumed directly by BI tools with minimal query complexity.

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

Performance optimizations include:

- Selective partitioning of large fact tables by `year`
- Column pruning via Parquet storage
- Precomputed Gold aggregations to reduce query-time computation
- Avoidance of partitioning for small dimension and aggregation tables to limit metadata overhead
